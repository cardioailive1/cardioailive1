#Genetic Variants and Risk Assessment 

""" Performance Metrics Overview
1. Prevalence of High-Risk Genetic Variants

    Current: Identification of 2-3 key variants
    Target: Identify > 5 key variants associated with myocardial infarction (MI) risk
    Data Source: Population Genomic Studies, Literature Review

2. Risk Stratification Accuracy

    Current: 75-80%
    Target: 90% accuracy in predicting high-risk individuals
    Data Source: Risk Assessment Models, Clinical Validation

3. Genetic Risk Score (GRS) Calculation

    Current: Identification of 70-80% of high-risk individuals
    Target: 100% identification
    Data Source: Genotype-Phenotype Association Studies

4. Response to Treatment Variability

    Current: 60-70% correlation with treatment outcomes
    Target: â‰¥ 80% correlation
